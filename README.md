# Sorting & Searching algorithms checkpoint

In this checkpoint exercise i wrote this pseudocode that implements the Insertion Sort algorithm by inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted sequence of the array.

This results in a sorted array at the end of the algorithm execution.
